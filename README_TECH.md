# Technical README - Mathakine

> Updated: 17/03/2026

## Runtime Truth

- live backend runtime is the Starlette stack under `server/`
- active route truth is `server/routes/`
- active HTTP behavior is implemented by `server/handlers/` delegating to `app/services/`
- runtime/data boundary: `app.core.db_boundary` (run_db_bound, sync_db_session)
- `app/api/endpoints/*` is archived and not part of the active runtime

## Current Stability Baseline (post-F, 2026-03-17)

- `pytest -q --maxfail=20 --ignore=tests/api/test_admin_auth_stability.py --no-cov` -> `936 passed, 2 skipped`
- `black app/ server/ tests/ --check` -> green
- `isort app/ server/ tests/ --check-only --diff` -> green
- `mypy app/ server/ --ignore-missing-imports` -> green
- `flake8 app/ server/ --select=E9,F63,F7,F82` -> green
- backend CI coverage gate -> `63 %`

## Active Architecture Notes

### Diagnostic

- the diagnostic flow uses a signed `state_token`
- `/api/diagnostic/question` does not expose `correct_answer`
- trusted answer correction is resolved server-side through an opaque `pending_ref`
- the frontend may receive `correct_answer` only after answer submission for feedback

### Runtime boundaries

- `MATH_TRAINER_DEBUG` defaults to `false`
- external JSON error payloads no longer expose traceback or raw exception details
- `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH` is enforced before JSON/body parsing on the hardened request paths
- `/api/badges/available` is now explicitly bounded (`default=100`, `max=200`)

### Monitoring

- backend Sentry is initialized from `SENTRY_DSN` (fallback `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` kept only for backward compatibility)
- backend sends errors, HTTP traces, SQLAlchemy spans, and HTTP metrics
- backend profiling remains disabled by default (`SENTRY_PROFILES_SAMPLE_RATE=0`)
- frontend Sentry sends errors, traces, and Replay through `/monitoring`
- frontend Replay defaults are `0.1` baseline sessions and `1.0` on error
- Sentry release correlation should use the deployed commit via `SENTRY_RELEASE` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_RELEASE`

### Rate limiting

- production source of truth is Redis via `RedisRateLimitStore`
- `REDIS_URL` is mandatory in production
- Redis runtime failures are fail-closed on the protected scope
- challenge stream is now aligned on the same distributed backend limiter

## Iteration E + F Outcome

The backend is now materially stronger on:
- bounded typed contracts on auth recovery / verification (E) and auth_service (F1)
- decomposition of challenge_service create flow (E) and badge_requirement_engine volume (F2)
- isolated badge requirement validation (E) and admin badge create flow (F3)
- scoped typing (F4) and runtime/data boundary formalization (F5)
- replicability and operability closure (F6)

## Explicit Remaining Debt (post-F)

- residual weak contracts in auth paths not treated by F1 (e.g. authenticate_user_with_session)
- other clusters in badge_requirement_engine and admin_content_service not decomposed
- global strict mypy remains out of scope
- `app/services/enhanced_server_adapter.py` remains legacy compatibility
