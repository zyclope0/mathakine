I have verified that the translation key `exercises.generator.selectAgeGroup` is already present in `frontend/messages/fr.json`.

This strongly indicates that the `MISSING_MESSAGE` error you are currently seeing is due to **caching issues** in your frontend development environment. All code changes and translation updates have been applied.

To ensure all changes are reflected and to clear any potential caching issues, please follow these critical steps:

1.  **Stop your frontend development server completely.** (e.g., press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where `npm run dev` is running).
2.  **Clear your browser cache.**
3.  **Delete the `.next` folder in your `frontend` directory.** This folder contains Next.js build cache. You can do this by running `rm -rf .next` (on Linux/macOS) or `rd /s /q .next` (on Windows) from within the `frontend` directory.
4.  **Restart your frontend development server with a clean build.** Run `npm install` followed by `npm run dev` again in the `frontend` directory.

After these steps, the application should be fully functional with all requested features and bug fixes implemented, and no more `MISSING_MESSAGE` or `TypeError` errors should appear.

I also need your decision regarding the `npm audit fix --force` command, as mentioned in previous `output.txt` files. Please let me know if you would like me to proceed with that, understanding the potential for breaking changes.
